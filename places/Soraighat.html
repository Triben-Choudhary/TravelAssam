                        SARAIGHAT BRIDGE
                    </h2>
                    <p class="sheading">There are two bridge over the river Brahmaputra joining the north and south banks at Saraighat. The Old Saraighat Bridge is the first rail-cum-road bridge constructed over the Brahmaputra River in Assam. Adjacent New Saraighat Bridge is a road only bridge. Lachit Borphukan Park is situated on the south end and Chilarai Park situated on the north end of the bridge. The idea of constructing a bridge over the Brahmaputra was first mooted in 1910 and the thought gathered momentum during the Second World War. Initially there were doubts over the stability of the railway line between Bongaigaon and Amingaon following devastating floods in 1942-43. However, when the line had been satisfactorily stabilized, the Railway Minister announced the decision to construct the bridge in the Budget session of the Parliament in 1958. The bridge is 40 feet above the normal flood level of the river which also ensure free navigation. The bridge was closed for a major repair work from March 23, 2019 and was opened for traffic on June 20, 2019.

                        The New Saraighat bridge is constructed beside the old bridge which is slightly longer than the old bridge. It was inaugurated on January, 2017. </p>
