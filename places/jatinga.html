                        JATINGA, DIMA HASAO
                    </h2>
                    <p class="sheading"> Jatinga, a village on a ridge, is located in Dima Hasao district, Assam State in India. It is 330 kilometres (210 mi) south of Guwahati.The village is inhabited by about 2,500 Khasi-pnar tribal people and a few Assamese.At the end of the monsoon months especially on moonless and foggy dark nights between 6 p.m. and 9:30 p.m., birds are not disturbed by the locals but out of the dark northern skies will start to descend as they are attracted to lights. These dazed birds are captured using bamboo poles by the locals. The local tribals first took this natural phenomenon to be spirits flying from the sky to terrorize them. This phenomenon is not confined to a single species, with tiger bittern, black bittern, little egret, pond heron, Indian pitta, and kingfishers all being affected, as well as hill partridge, green pigeon, emerald dove, necklaced laughingthrush, black drongo. The birds are mostly juvenile, according to Assam's best known ornithologist, Anwaruddin Choudhury.Mainly, due to this curious phenomenon, travellers come in between the months of August to November, especially ornithologists and bird watchers. The village is inhabited by about 2,500 Khasi-pnar tribal people and few Dimasa people.
