                    Kareng Ghar
                    </h2>
                    <p class="sheading">Kareng ("royal palace"), also known as The Garhgaon Palace, is located in Garhgaon 15 kilometres (9.3 mi) from Sivasagar, Assam, India.Of all Ahom ruins, the Kareng Ghar is one of the grandest examples of Ahom architecture. The palace structures were made of wood and stone. In 1751 Sunenphaa, son of Sukhrungphaa, constructed the brick wall of about 5 kilometres (3.1 mi) in length surrounding the Garhgaon Palace and the masonry gate leading to it.After the destruction of the old palace it was rebuilt around 1752 as the present seven-storied structure by Suremphaa (reign: 1751-1769).The earliest constructions were commissioned by Sukhrungphaa in AD 1698.Rangpur was the capital of the Ahom Kingdom and served as its military station.After Sukhrungphaa's death, the Kareng Ghar went through many architectural alterations to its structure, which resulted in its irregular shape.The Kareng was built mainly of wood, which was largely destroyed over time.The royal apartments were on the upper storey, of which only a few rooms now remain, close to an octagonal room on the northern wing which once served as the Puja Ghar (prayer house).There are stairs leading up to the terrace. An isolated room stands on the south which is believed to have been used by the queen during her confinement. </p>
